Q:How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
A: Very confident! I took a Ruby class on Codeacademy before applying at Turing so these concepts are familiar to me at this point.

Q: Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
A: Not at this point.

Q: What questions do you have about Arrays?
A: No questions at the moment.  I saw there is a very long lists of methods on ruby-doc.org so I'm looking forward to learning how to apply more methods.
